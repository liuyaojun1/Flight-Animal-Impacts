# Code of Conduct (Flight–Animal Impacts Dashboard)

## Introduction
In order to create a safe, positive, productive, and happy community, we adopt this Code of Conduct for the **Flight–Animal Impacts Dashboard** project.

A code of conduct is an outward-facing document that explains social norms, acceptable behaviour, and general etiquette expected in our project spaces. This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related interactions, including (but not limited to): in-person meetings, Zoom, email, Canvas discussions, GitHub (issues, pull requests, code reviews), and any messaging platforms used by the team.

All participants are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

## Inclusivity & Harassment-Free Participation
We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or disrespectful behaviour based on personal characteristics, including (but not limited to): gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnicity, religion or belief (or lack thereof), age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, or experience level.

## Expected Behaviour
We encourage the following behaviours in all project spaces:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Give and receive constructive feedback professionally
- Assume good intent, ask clarifying questions, and communicate clearly
- Focus on what is best for the learning environment and the project outcome
- Respect others’ time (e.g., reasonable response times, meeting etiquette, clear deadlines)
- Support equitable participation (e.g., avoid dominating discussions; invite input from others)

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Discriminatory, harassing, insulting, or demeaning comments (spoken or written)
- Excluding others or making people feel unsafe or unwelcome
- Threats, intimidation, stalking, or sustained disruption of meetings or online discussions
- Unwelcome sexual attention or non-consensual physical contact
- Sharing sexual or violent imagery in project spaces
- Continuing to contact or engage with someone after being asked to stop
- Publishing private communications or personal information without explicit consent
- Encouraging or inciting violence, suicide, or self-harm

## Consequences
If someone is asked to stop unacceptable behaviour, they are expected to comply immediately.

If unacceptable behaviour continues or is severe, the issue may be escalated to the course instructor for review and appropriate action.

## Reporting Procedure
If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please report it directly to the course instructor:

- **Instructor:** Fatemeh Hendijani Fard  
- **Email:** Fatemeh.fard@ubc.ca  

When reporting, it helps to include:
- What happened (short description)
- When and where it happened (platform/context)
- Who was involved (and any witnesses, if applicable)
- Any relevant links/screenshots (only if you are comfortable sharing)
